# Project Description

Coding One Final Project 
# What
This mini project is about HTMLCSS JavaScript Threejs and it’s finally made a login and registration page with particle system, interaction design, and computational graphics element. I think it has counting the knowledge from our courses like shapes and lines, polar coordinates, Webgl, 3D coordinates, Cartesian coordinates and so on.
# Why
To be honest in this term, I’m still trying to find out what is the connection between the things I learned from coding one, course, and my skills I had before, and the work I have to do in the future. The answer is finally I find something I think which is practical. If you have checked my introduction video, you can find that in a final page of my project is connect to the JD page, I had an internship in JD so I use that brand. Besides, I found every platform or to say every online shopping app needs a registration and login. I used to know nothing about it but now I think I can deal with that. After finishing this, I found it really meaningful.
# How
◦ After practicing the code taught by our professors on mimic platform, I had some understanding of my own for the coding so I started to learn what
I’m interested in in YouTube and other study spaces online.
◦
I have concluded our knowledge. The mimic platform I heard that this one is built by our professor, that is really cool, the basic logic of using it, and the visual effects is really great. I have to say I didn’t use parity resolution and the sampling rate. But in weekly homework, homework for week two we have to use for voices and make it changeable in two minutes. I think I did well in that. It gives me more possibility for DJ music. The computer graphics really takes my time cause I’m not really good at math or physics. Even it is hard for me to understand the meaning of each word like Pixel manipulation. Then it’s come to week six after learning about 3-D graphics and shapes it can be much easier to understand the webGL and models and threejs things.
I have to say the homework for week seven is too hard for me. Besides, it has striking on that week. I don’t know that till now.
# Critical review
◦ Firstly, I have to say the things it’s not pretty. Including the background and the interface.
◦ Secondly, I don’t have any creative thoughts on how to improve the Aesthetics.
◦ Thirdly, I am not able to find what is design and art in this term of my learning. Maybe computer science and normal coding has no things with art and design but we are still in UAL. I have been wandering on that for a while. ◦ Last but not least after I have finished, I found that this one is not much like the things I have learned on Minic platform. I’m not sure how bad is that.
